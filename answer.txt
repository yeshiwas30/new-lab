1. It reads input from the user on the standard input stream,
  and then forwards that text to the echo server by writing 
  the text to the socket.
2. Because the internet address is always unique to a particular
  host on a network, the socket address for a particular socket 
  on a particular host is unique. Additionally, because each 
  connects fully specified by the pair of sockets it joins , every
  connection between internet hosts is also uniquely identified
3.
 there is no bind function so no function to associate a local
  address with a socket   if there is no server there won't have 
  listen function that places a socket in a state in which it is 
  listening for an incoming connection and accept function that 
  permits an incoming connection attempt on a socket.
